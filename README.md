# **The Truth Is Out There...Or Is It?**
## **Overview of Project:**
### Are UFOs powered by little green men, or is there a more logical explanation? We may never know the answer to this controversial question, but we do have a large collection of data on UFO sightings to dig through and possibly help us in coming to our own conclusions. Our team has developed a website which allows UFO enthusiasts to filter data on sightings by various parameters, including date, location, and type of UFO. 
## **Results:**
### Our [website](https://elissewright.github.io/UFOs/) is live and ready for you to visit! ![Home Page](https://github.com/elissewright/UFOs/blob/main/website.png)
### Upon visiting the home page, scroll down to see the search boxes on the left side. Here, you can filter data on UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The search boxes are filled in with some suggestions, but you can search for the dates, locations, or UFO types of your choice by filling in any of the fields and hitting the enter button. You can clear the field(s) and select new ones by refreshing the page. 
### Here is an example of a search for UFO sightings within the state of Oregon: ![Oregon Sightings](https://github.com/elissewright/UFOs/blob/main/oregon_search.png)
### For another example, you can see results for UFOs that appeared in a formation shape: ![Formation Sightings](https://github.com/elissewright/UFOs/blob/main/formation.png)
## **Summary:**
### While our website has many features in allowing visitors to sort through UFO data, it is still in its early stages and will be improved with future updates which will allow for additional features. One major drawback for visitors is the inability to search for additional fields, such as duration and comments. A future update may allow for visitors to search for specific keywords which appear in the comments section of the data, as this section contains significant important information. Another drawback to our current website is that our data set is limited to certain locations and dates, and a search for a date or location that does not appear within the set will simply not return any output. A future update will return a popup box letting visitors know that no data exists for that input, along with a suggestion for more relevant terms to search for.
