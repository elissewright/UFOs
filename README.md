# **The Truth Is Out There...Or Is It?**
## **Overview of Project:**
### Are UFOs powered by little green men, or is there a more logical explanation? We may never know the answer to this controversial question, but we do have a large collection of data on UFO sightings to dig through and possibly help us in coming to our own conclusions. Our team has developed a website which allows UFO enthusiasts to filter data on sightings by various parameters, including date, location, and type of UFO. 
## **Results:**
### Our [website](https://elissewright.github.io/UFOs/) is live and ready for you to visit! ![Home Page](https://github.com/elissewright/UFOs/blob/main/website.png)
### Upon visiting the home page, scroll down to see the search boxes on the left side. Here, you can filter data on UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO. The search boxes are filled in with some suggestions, but you can search for the dates, locations, or UFO types of your choice by filling in any of the fields and hitting the enter button. 
### Here is an example of a search for UFO sightings within the state of Oregon: ![Oregon Sightings](https://github.com/elissewright/UFOs/blob/main/oregon_search.png)
### For another example, you can see results for UFOs that appeared in a formation shape: ![Formation Sightings](https://github.com/elissewright/UFOs/blob/main/formation.png)
## **Summary:**
### In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
